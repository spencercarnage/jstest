# jstest

##this is in the very early, early stages.##

This is the beginning of an interactive test that will be used as part of a
presentation on JS Best Practices & Standards. Instead telling participants why
creating functions in a `for` loop is bad, we can quiz them them in real-time
on what they know, making it a fun activity for all.

`gulp` needs to be installed globally:

```
npm i gulp -g
```

Once `gulp` is installed, run it:

```
gulp
```
Then visit `localhost:3000`. For some strange reason it may be an empty page
when you first visit `localhost:3000`. Refresh the page and you'll see a simple
input box and button.
